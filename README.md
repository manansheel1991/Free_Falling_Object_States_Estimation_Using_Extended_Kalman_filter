Estimating heights and velocities of a free falling object using Extended Kalman Filter in MATLAB

When we study physics in high school, we generally
ignore the effects of air resistance and buoyancy on a
free-falling body. This is done to make our task easy,
convenient and to give insight into Newtonâ€™s second
law of motion. But in actual situations, air buoyancy
and resistance come into play unless we are doing the
experiment in vacuum. If we continue using our
theoretical model of high school physics, we will get
great error in our measurement. Also, in our
experiment, there are various random factors that come
into play like imperfections in modelling, measurement
and other random factors. The model of a free-falling
body is a non-linear model when air buoyancy and
resistance are considered. We have used an
Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the states of the
same.
